== Random imgur picture finder ==
Gets random images from imgur.

Made by Sebbe (of Something Awful), inspired by http://jsfiddle.net/KzfKf/44/embedded/result/ .

Requires the [F# runtime 2.0](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=13450). If the program crashes before starting, install that.

If you still cannot run the application, try installing the [.NET 4.0 Runtime](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17851).
