# Random imgur picture finder
Gets random images from imgur.

Made by Sebbe (of Something Awful), inspired by http://jsfiddle.net/KzfKf/44/embedded/result/ .

## Requirements
Requires the [F# runtime 2.0](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=13450). If the program crashes before starting, install that.

If you still cannot run the application, try installing the [.NET 4.0 Runtime](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17851).

If you're on Linux, it should work fine with [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com), as long as you install the [F# compiler/runtime](https://github.com/fsharp/fsharp), too. Note, it needs to be the .NET 4.0 runtime, and not the .NET 2.0 one.
